## __ESO Furnishing Mat Prices__

I started tracking the price of furnishing materials in *Elder Scrolls Online* in late 2019, originally just to get a sense of what was normal, and later to demonstrate how bizarre some price shifts were.

With this project, I intend to compare how prices of each material have changed over time.

### __Data Source__

Prices were recorded by me from the Tamriel Trade Centre add-on and website (https://us.tamrieltradecentre.com/pc/Trade). Each date includes the suggested price ranges for the PCNA server only.
